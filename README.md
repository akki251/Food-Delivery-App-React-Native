Using this app, They will be able to browse restaurant menus, add dishes to a virtual cart, and place orders.

The backend will be built using Sanity and will store the data related to the restaurants, menus, orders, and user accounts. Sanity will provide a flexible, powerful, and secure platform for data storage as well as a user-friendly content management system for restaurant owners to manage their menus. 

The project will also integrate with Google Maps to provide location data for restaurants. 

Overall, this project will create a streamlined experience for users to order food online from their favorite restaurants.
